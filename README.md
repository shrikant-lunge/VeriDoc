# VeriDoc
VeriDoc is a document upload and verification system built using Spring Boot and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to upload documents, generate a unique verification code, and verify document integrity later. The system detects tampering and displays clear valid or invalid results through a modern user interface.
